        "3. Ask the Player for their bet.\n",

        "7. Show both of the Player's cards.\n",
        "8. Ask the Player if they wish to Hit, and take another card.\n",
        "9. If the Player's hand doesn't Bust (go over 21), ask if they'd like to Hit again.\n",
        "10. If a Player Stands, play the Dealer's hand. The dealer will always Hit until the Dealer's value meets or exceeds 17.\n",
